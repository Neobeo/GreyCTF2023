       "\"in a ctf context, forensics challenges can include file format analysis, steganography, memory dump analysis, or network packet capture analysis. any challenge to examine and process a hidden piece of information out of static data files as opposed to executable programs or remote servers could be considered a forensics challenge unless it involves cryptography, in which case it probably belongs in the crypto category. forensics is a broad ctf category that does not map well to any particular job role in the security industry, although some challenges model the kinds of tasks seen in incident response ir. even in ir work, computer forensics is usually the domain of law enforcement seeking evidentiary data and attribution, rather than the commercial incident responder who may just be interested in expelling an attacker andor restoring system integrity. unlike most ctf forensics challenges, a real world computer forensics task would hardly ever involve unraveling a scheme of cleverly encoded bytes, hidden data, like files within files, or other such brain teaser puzzles. one would typically not bust a criminal case by carefully reassembling a corrupted png file, revealing a photo of a qr code that decodes to a password for a zip archive containing an nes rom that when played will output the confession. rather, real world forensics typically requires that a practictioner find indirect evidence of maliciousness either the traces of an attacker on a system, or the traces of insider threat behavior. real world computer forensics is largely about knowing where to find incriminating clues in logs, in memory, in file systems registries, and associated file and filesystem metadata. also, network packet capture forensics is more about metadata analysis than content analysis, as most network sessions are tls encrypted between endpoints now. this disconnect between the somewhat artificial puzzle game ctf forensics and the way that forensics is actually done in the field might be why this category does not receive as much attention as the vulnerability exploitation style challenges. it may also lack the black hat attacker appeal that draws many players to participate in ctfs. regardless, many players enjoy the variety and novelty in ctf forensics challenges. it can also be a more beginner friendly category, in which the playing field is evened out by the fact that there are no professional tools like ida pro ultimate edition with hex rays decompiler that would give a huge advantage to some players but not others, as is the case with executable analysis challenges. requisite skills for solving forensics ctf challenges, the three most useful abilities are probably knowing a scripting language e.g., python knowing how to manipulate binary data byte level manipulations in that language recognizing formats, protocols, structures, and encodings the first and second you can learn and practice outside of a ctf, but the third may only come from experience. hopefully with this document, you can at least get a good head start. and of course, like most ctf play, the ideal environment is a linux system with q'  occasionally q'  windows in a vm. macos is not a bad environment to substitute for linux, if you can accept that some open source tools may not install or compile correctly. manipulating binary data in python assuming you have already picked up some python programming, you still may not know how to effectively work with binary data. low level languages like c might be more naturally suited for this task, but python's many useful packages from the open source community outweigh its learning curve for working with binary data. here are some examples of working with binary data in python. the byte array type has most of the same convenient methods as a python str or list split, insert, reverse, extend, pop, remove, etc. reading a file into a byte array for processing common forensics concepts and tools what follows is a high level overview of some of the common concepts in forensics ctf challenges, and some recommended tools for performing common tasks. file format identification and magic bytes almost every forensics challenge will involve a file, usually without any context that would give you a guess as to what the file is. filetypes, as a concept for users, have historically been indicated either with filetype extensions e.g., readme.md for markdown, mime types as on the web, with content type headers, or with metadata stored in the filesystem as with the mdls command in macos. in a ctf, part of the game is to identify the file ourselves, using a heuristic approach. the traditional heuristic for identifying filetypes on unix is lib magic, which is a library for identifying so called magic numbers or magic bytes, the unique identifying marker bytes in filetype headers. the lib magic library is the basis for the file command. keep in mind that heuristics, and tools that employ them, can be easily fooled. because it is a ctf, you may be presented with a file that has been intentionally crafted to mislead file. also, if a file contains another file embedded somewhere inside it, the file command is only going to identify the containing filetype. in scenarios such as these you may need to examine the file content more closely. trid is a more sophisticated version of file. although it's closed source, it's free and works across platforms. it also uses an identification heuristic, but with certainty percentages. its advantage is its larger set of known filetypes that include a lot of proprietary and obscure formats seen in the real world. file carving files within files is a common trope in forensics ctf challenges, and also in embedded systems' firmware where primitive or flat file systems are common. the term for identifying a file embedded in another file and extracting it is file carving. one of the best tools for this task is the firmware analysis tool binwalk. scalpel, now a part of sleuthkit discussed further under file systems is another tool for file carving, formerly known as foremost. to manually extract a sub section of a file from a known offset to a known offset, you can use the dd command. many hex editors also offer the ability to copy bytes and paste them as a new file, so you don't need to study the offsets. although the above tools should suffice, in some cases you may need to programmatically extract a sub section of a file using python, using things like python's re or regex modules to identify magic bytes, and the zlib module to extract zlib streams. initial analysis at first you may not have any leads, and need to explore the challenge file at a high level for a clue toward what to look at next. some of the useful commands to know are strings to search for all plain text strings in the file, grep to search for particular strings, bgrep to search for non text data patterns, and hexdump. example of using strings to find ascii strings, with file offsets unicode strings, if they are utf 8, might show up in the search for ascii strings. but to search for other encodings, see the documentation for the e flag. beware the many encoding pitfalls of strings some caution against its use in forensics at all, but for simple tasks it still has its place. example of searching for the png magic bytes in a png file the advantage of hexdump is not that it is the best hex editor it's not, but that you can pipe output of other commands directly into hexdump, andor pipe its output to grep, or format its output using format strings. example of using hexdump format strings to output the first 50 bytes of a file as a series of 64 bit integers in hex binary as text encodings binary is 1's and 0's, but often is transmitted as text. it would be wasteful to transmit actual sequences of 101010101, so the data is first encoded using one of a variety of methods. this is what is referred to as binary to text encoding, a popular trope in ctf challenges. when doing a strings analysis of a file as discussed above, you may uncover this binary data encoded as text strings. we mentioned that to excel at forensics ctf challenges, it is important to be able to recognize encodings. some can be identifed at a glance, such as base64 encoded content, identifiable by its alphanumeric charset and its padding suffix when present. there are many base64 encoderdecoders online, or you can use the base64 command ascii encoded hexadecimal is also identifiable by its charset 0 9, a f. ascii characters themselves occupy a certain range of bytes 0x00 through 0x7f, see man ascii, so if you are examining a file and find a string like 68 65 6c 6c 6f 20 77 6f 72 6c 64 21, it's important to notice the preponderance of 0x60's here this is ascii. technically, it's text hello world. encoded as ascii binary encoded as hexadecimal text again. confused yet there are several sites that provide online encoder decoders for a variety of encodings. for a more local converter, try the xxd command. common file formats we've discussed the fundamental concepts and the tools for the more generic forensics tasks. now, we'll discuss more specific categories of forensics challenges, and the recommended tools for analyzing challenges in each category. it would be impossible to prepare for every possible data format, but there are some that are especially popular in ctfs. if you were prepared with tools for analyzing the following, you would be prepared for the majority of forensics challenges some of the harder ctf challenges pride themselves on requiring players to analyze an especially obscure format for which no publicly available tools exist. you will need to learn to quickly locate documentation and tools for unfamiliar formats. many file formats are well described in the public documentation you can find with a web search, but having some familiarity with the file format specifications will also help, so we include links to those here. when analyzing file formats, a file format aware a.k.a. templated hex editor like 010 editor is invaluable. an open source alternative has emerged called kaitai. additionally, a lesser known feature of the wireshark network protocol analyzer is its ability to analyze certain media file formats like gif, jpg, and png. all of these tools, however, are made to analyze non corrupted and well formatted files. many ctf challenges task you with reconstructing a file based on missing or zeroed out format fields, etc. you also ought to check out the wonderful file formats illustrated visually by ange albertini. archive files most ctf challenges are contained in a zip, 7z, rar, tar or tgz file, but only in a forensics challenge will the archive container file be a part of the challenge itself. usually the goal here is to extract a file from a damaged archive, or find data embedded somewhere in an unused field a common forensics challenge. zip is the most common in the real world, and the most common in ctfs. there are a handful of command line tools for zip files that will be useful to know about. one important security related note about password protected zip files is that they do not encrypt the filenames and original file sizes of the compressed files they contain, unlike password protected rar or 7z files. another note about zip cracking is that if you have an unencrypteduncompressed copy of any one of the files that is compressed in the encrypted zip, you can perform a plaintext attack and crack the zip, as detailed here, and explained in this paper. the newer scheme for password protecting zip files with aes 256, rather than zipcrypto does not have this weakness. image file format analysis ctfs are supposed to be fun, and image files are good for containing hacker memes, so of course image files often appear in ctf challenges. image file formats are complex and can be abused in many ways that make for interesting analysis puzzles involving metadata fields, lossy and lossless compression, checksums, steganography, or visual data encoding schemes. the easy initial analysis step is to check an image file's metadata fields with exiftool. if an image file has been abused for a ctf, its exif might identify the original image dimensions, camera type, embedded thumbnail image, comments and copyright strings, gps location coordinates, etc. there might be a gold mine of metadata, or there might be almost nothing. it's worth a look. png files, in particular, are popular in ctf challenges, probably for their lossless compression suitable for hiding non visual data in the image. png files can be dissected in wireshark. to verify correcteness or attempt to repair corrupted pngs you can use pngcheck. if you need to dig into png a little deeper, the pngtools package might be useful. steganography, the practice of concealing some amount of secret data within an unrelated data as its vessel a.k.a. the cover text, is extraordinarily rare in the real world made effectively obsolete by strong cryptography, but is another popular trope in ctf forensics challenges. steganography could be implemented using any kind of data as the cover text, but media file formats are ideal because they tolerate a certain amount of unnoticeable data loss the same characteristic that makes lossy compression schemes possible. the difficulty with steganography is that extracting the hidden message requires not only a detection that steganography has been used, but also the exact steganographic tool used to embed it. given a challenge file, if we suspect steganography, we must do at least a little guessing to check if it's present. stegsolve jar download link is often used to apply various steganography techniques to image files in an attempt to detect and extract hidden data. you may also try zsteg. gimp provides the ability to alter various aspects of the visual data of an image file. ctf challenge authors have historically used altered huesaturationluminance values or color channels to hide a secret message. gimp is also good for confirming whether something really is an image file for instance, when you believe you have recovered image data from a display buffer in a memory dump or elsewhere, but you lack the image file header that specifies pixel format, image height and width and so on. open your mystery data as raw image data in gimp and experiment with different settings. the imagemagick toolset can be incorporated into scripts and enable you to quickly identify, resize, crop, modify, convert, and otherwise manipulate image files. it can also find the visual and data difference between two seemingly identical images with its compare tool. if you are writing a custom image file format parser, import the python image library pil aka pillow. it enables you to extract frames from animated gifs or even individual pixels from a jpg q'  it has native support for most major image file formats. if working with qr codes 2d barcodes, also check out the qrtools module for python. you can decode an image of a qr code with less than 5 lines of python. of course, if you just need to decode one qr code, any smartphone will do. filesystems analysis occasionally, a ctf forensics challenge consists of a full disk image, and the player needs to have a strategy for finding a needle the flag in this haystack of data. triage, in computer forensics, refers to the ability to quickly narrow down what to look at. without a strategy, the only option is looking at everything, which is time prohibitive not to mention exhausting. once you have mounted the filesystem, the tree command is not bad for a quick look at the directory structure to see if anything sticks out to you for further analysis. you may not be looking for a file in the visible filesystem at all, but rather a hidden volume, unallocated space disk space that is not a part of any partition, a deleted file, or a non file filesystem structure like an http www.nirsoft.netutilsalternate_data_streams.html. for ext3 and ext4 filesystems, you can attempt to find deleted files with extundelete. for everything else, there's testdisk recover missing partition tables, fix corrupted ones, undelete files on fat or ntfs, etc. the sleuth kit and its accompanying web based user interface, autopsy, is a powerful open source toolkit for filesystem analysis. it's a bit geared toward law enforcement tasks, but can be helpful for tasks like searching for a keyword across the entire disk image, or looking at the unallocated space. embedded device filesystems are a unique category of their own. made for fixed function low resource environments, they can be compressed, single file, or read only. squashfs is one popular implementation of an embedded device filesystem. for images of embedded devices, you're better off analyzing them with firmware mod kit or binwalk. packet capture pcap file analysis network traffic is stored and captured in a pcap file packet capture, with a program like tcpdump or wireshark both based on libpcap. a popular ctf challenge is to provide a pcap file representing some network traffic and challenge the player to recoverreconstitute a transferred file or transmitted secret. complicating matters, the packets of interest are usually in an ocean of unrelated traffic, so analysis triage and filtering the data is also a job for the player. for initial analysis, take a high level view of the packets with wireshark's statistics or conversations view, or its capinfos command. wireshark, and its command line version tshark, both support the concept of using filters, which, if you master the syntax, can quickly reduce the scope of your analysis. there is also an online service called packettotal where you can submit pcap files up to 50mb, and graphically display some timelines of connections, and ssl metadata on the secure connections. plus it will highlight file transfers and show you any suspicious activity. if you already know what you're searching for, you can do grep style searching through packets using ngrep. just as file carving refers to the identification and extraction of files embedded within files, packet carving is a term sometimes used to describe the extraction of files from a packet capture. there are expensive commercial tools for recovering files from captured packets, but one open source alternative is the xplico framework. wireshark also has an export objects feature to extract data from the capture e.g., file export objects http save all. beyond that, you can try tcpxtract, network miner, foremost, or snort. if you want to write your own scripts to process pcap files directly, the dpkt python package for pcap manipulation is recommended. you could also interface wireshark from your python using wirepy. if trying to repair a damaged pcap file, there is an online service for repairing pcap files called pcapfix. a note about pcap vs pcapng there are two versions of the pcap file format pcapng is newer and not supported by all tools. you may need to convert a file from pcapng to pcap using wireshark or another compatible tool, in order to work with it in some other tools. memory dump analysis for years, computer forensics was synonymous with filesystem forensics, but as attackers became more sophisticated, they started to avoid the disk. also, a snapshot of memory often contains context and clues that are impossible to find on disk because they only exist at runtime operational configurations, remote exploit shellcode, passwords and encryption keys, etc. so memory snapshot memory dump forensics has become a popular practice in incident response. in a ctf, you might find a challenge that provides a memory dump image, and tasks you with locating and extracting a secret or a file from within it. the premiere open source framework for memory dump analysis is volatility. volatility is a python script for parsing memory dumps that were gathered with an external tool or a vmware memory image gathered by pausing the vm. so, given the memory dump file and the relevant profile the os from which the dump was gathered, volatility can start identifying the structures in the data running processes, passwords, etc. it is also extensible using plugins for extracting various types of artifact. ethscan is made to find data in a memory dump that looks like network packets, and then extract it into a pcap file for viewing in wireshark. there are plugins for extracting sql databases, chrome history, firefox history and much more. pdf file analysis pdf is an extremely complicated document file format, with enough tricks and hiding places to write about for years. this also makes it popular for ctf forensics challenges. the nsa wrote a guide to these hiding places in 2008 titled hidden data and metadata in adobe pdf files publication risks and countermeasures. it's no longer available at its original url, but you can find a copy here. ange albertini also keeps a wiki on github of pdf file format tricks. the pdf format is partially plain text, like html, but with many binary objects in the contents. didier stevens has written good introductory material about the format. the binary objects can be compressed or even encrypted data, and include content in scripting languages like javascript or flash. to display the structure of a pdf, you can either browse it with a text editor, or open it with a pdf aware file format editor like origami. qpdf is one tool that can be useful for exploring a pdf and transforming or extracting information from it. another is a framework in ruby called origami. when exploring pdf content for hidden data, some of the hiding places to check include grey{y0u_h4v3_4_mus1c4l_t4l3nt_t00_c207584111e9a5bcd5d27813b719dee8p non visible layers adobe's metadata format xmp the incremental generation feature of pdf wherein a previous version is retained but not visible to the user white text on a white background text behind images an image behind an overlapping image non displayed comments there are also several python packages for working with the pdf file format, like peepdf, that enable you to write your own parsing scripts. video and audio file analysis like image file formats, audio and video file trickery is a common theme in ctf forensics challenges not because hacking or data hiding ever happens this way in the real world, but just because audio and video is fun. as with image file formats, stegonagraphy might be used to embed a secret message in the content data, and again you should know to check the file metadata areas for clues. your first step should be to take a look with the mediainfo tool or exiftool and identify the content type and look at its metadata. audacity is the premiere open source audio file and waveform viewing tool, and ctf challenge authors love to encode text into audio waveforms, which you can see using the spectogram view although a specialized tool called sonic visualiser is better for this task in particular. audacity can also enable you to slow down, reverse, and do other manipulations that might reveal a hidden message if you suspect there is one if you can hear garbled audio, interference, or static. sox is another useful command line tool for converting and manipulating audio files. it's also common to check least significant bits lsb for a secret message. most audio and video media formats use discrete fixed size chunks so that they can be streamed the lsbs of those chunks are a common place to smuggle some data without visibly affecting the file. other times, a message might be encoded into the audio as dtmf tones or morse code. for these, try working with multimon ng to decode them. video file formats are really container formats, that contain separate streams of both audio and video that are multiplexed together for playback. for analyzing and manipulating video file formats, ffmpeg is recommended. ffmpeg i gives initial analysis of the file content. it can also de multiplex or playback the content streams. the power of ffmpeg is exposed to python using ffmpy. office file analysis microsoft has created dozens of office document file formats, many of which are popular for the distribution of phishing attacks and malware because of their ability to include macros vba scripts. microsoft office document forensic analysis is not too different from pdf document forensics, and just as relevant to real world incident response. broadly speaking, there are two generations of office file format the ole formats file extensions like rtf, doc, xls, ppt, and the office open xml formats file extensions that include docx, xlsx, pptx. both formats are structured, compound file binary formats that enable linked or embedded content objects. ooxml files are actually zip file containers see the section above on archive files, meaning that one of the easiest ways to check for hidden data is to simply unzip the document as you can see, some of the structure is created by the file and folder hierarchy. the rest is specified inside the xml files. new steganographic techniques for the ooxml file format, 2011 details some ideas for data hiding techniques, but ctf challenge authors will always be coming up with new ones. once again, a python toolset exists for the examination and analysis of ole and ooxml documents oletools. for ooxml documents in particular, officedissector is a very powerful analysis framework and python library. the latter includes a quick guide to its usage. sometimes the challenge is not to find hidden static data, but to analyze a vba macro to determine its behavior. this is a more realistic scenario, and one that analysts in the field perform every day. the aforementioned dissector tools can indicate whether a macro is present, and probably extract it for you. a typical vba macro in an office document, on windows, will download a powershell script to temp and attempt to execute it, in which case you now have a powershell script analysis task too. but malicious vba macros are rarely complicated, since vba is typically just used as a jumping off platform to bootstrap code execution. in the case where you do need to understand a complicated vba macro, or if the macro is obfuscated and has an unpacker routine, you don't need to own a license to microsoft office to debug this. you can use libre office its interface will be familiar to anyone who has debugged a program you can set breakpoints and create watch variables and capture values after they have been unpacked but before whatever payload behavior has executed. you can even start a macro of a specific document from a command line \""
