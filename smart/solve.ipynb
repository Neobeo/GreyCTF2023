    "So I didn't actually manage to solve this challenge live, but the solution is semi-obvious in hindsight.\n",
    "\n",
    "Roughly speaking, you are a given a function $f : \\mathbb{Z}^4 \\to \\mathbb{Z}_{1657} \\times \\mathbb{Z}_{1663} \\times \\mathbb{Z}_{1049} \\times \\mathbb{Z}_{1193}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "And then you also have a funcion $h(a,b,c,d) = f^k(a,b,c,d)$ where $k = 5555 + (abcd \\bmod{3000000})$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The challenge is that it generates you the value of $target := h(v_0,v_1,v_2,v_3)$ from some initial state whose values are random 32-bit ints, and you have to find values $(a,b,c,d) \\in \\mathbb{Z}_{1657} \\times \\mathbb{Z}_{1663} \\times \\mathbb{Z}_{1049} \\times \\mathbb{Z}_{1193}$ satisfying $h(a,b,c,d) = target$.\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, the original 32-bit state is (usually) not a valid solution, because the values tend to be larger than 4 digits each.\n",
    "\n",
    "Anyway, the solve path seems obvious for the most part: if you can invert $f$ efficiently, then you can just keep doing this and checking if satisfies the $h$ condition. Now $f$ looks almost linear, but with a quadratic and a quartic term thrown into the mix. So I spent most of my time trying to exploit the near-linearity to invert it, but did not manage to do so.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead, the intended solution is to keep iterating $f$ _forwards_ until it hits a cycle. Since there's only roughly $2^{42}$ possible outcomes of $f$, the birthday paradox (or similar) basically states that if you iterate $O(2^{21})$ times there's a good chance your $f$ will hit a value you've already seen, and there's your cycle! Plus this has the added bonus of inverting all those states as well, not just one at a time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Anyway, once you know this trick it's all trivial, so here's the solve script:"
